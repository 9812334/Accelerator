### Installation without Docker ###
1. install nodeJs
2. run: npm install
3. run: node server.js
4. surf to: http://127.0.0.1:8080

Note: 
* To serve it online you need a reverse proxy and deliver with https (look at "Behind a reverse Proxy" below)
* On some linux systems you need to install some extra deps to run puppeteer: [here](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md).

### Docker Installation ###
1. build . -t acc
2. run: docker run -d --net=host acc
3. surf to http://yourIp:8080

Note: 
* To serve it online you need a reverse proxy and deliver with https (look at "Behind a reverse Proxy" below)
* To have all persistent datas (config, rooms, presentations...) outside of docker, you can run it like this:

```
docker run -d --name acc --net=host -v /home/acc/config:/app/config -v /home/acc/db:/app/db  -v /home/acc/3dObjs:/app/public/3dObjs -v /home/acc/praesis:/app/public/praesis -v /home/acc/profilePics:/app/public/profilePics -v /home/acc/singlefiles:/app/public/singlefiles acc
```


### Configuration ###
On the first start a new folder "/config" will be generated. Take a look at "/config/config.json" for all parameters. Change them if you like, and restart the server. More to come...

### ToDos ###

- [ ] Better error feedback
- [ ] More, better docs
- [ ] SIP Integration
- [ ] Recording of Audio/Video (Prototype working)
- [ ] Convert WebRTC Streams to RTMP so we can stream to youtube/twitch live (Prototype working)

### GoodToKnow ###

* Audio/Video is not Peer2Peer so it will use some server CPU
* Max users per loadbalancer is about 256.
* Video is disabled in rooms with more than 6 People due to hight load (Only enabled for moderator).
* Firefox sometimes has some issues with the WebRTC audio/video, use chrome to be save
* If you are running without docker, conversion to PDF presentaions (From Powerpoint and other Docs) will not work without installing "unoconv" on your own 
* Setup a TURN Server if your clients are behind Firewalls and NATs (See config, setup below)
* This was/is a student project and was build in one Semester so don't expect enterprise code :)

### TURN Setup/Configuration ###
1. Setup your TURN Container on an extra Server: [HowTo](https://github.com/cracker0dks/turn-server-docker-image/blob/master/README.md)
2. Make a new "iceServers" entry in "/config/config.json"
```
{
	"url": "turn:IP_TO_TURN:443",
	"turnServerCredential": "authSecret",
	"username": "webrtcuser"
}
```
- "username" can be anything you like.
- "turnServerCredential" must be the "authSecret" form the TURN Server installation.

Restart the server.

### Behind a nginx reverse Proxy ###
```
location /accelerator/ {
	resolver 127.0.0.1 valid=30s;
	proxy_set_header HOST $host;
	proxy_http_version 1.1;
	proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
	proxy_set_header Connection upgrade;
	proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;
}
```

### Behind an Apache reverse Proxy ### 

```
<VirtualHost example.org:443>
...
# Proxy /accelerator/ to accelerator container
ProxyPass "/accelerator/" "http://127.0.0.1:8080/"
ProxyPassReverse "/accelerator/" "http://127.0.0.1:8080/"
...
</VirtualHost>
```
